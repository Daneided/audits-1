# Risk Classification

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |

## Impact

- High - leads to a significant material loss of assets in the protocol or significantly harms a group of users.

- Medium - leads to a moderate material loss of assets in the protocol or moderately harms a group of users.

- Low - leads to a minor material loss of assets in the protocol or harms a small group of users.

## Likelihood

- High - attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions, and the cost of the attack is relatively low compared to the amount of funds that can be stolen or lost.

- Medium - only a conditionally incentivized attack vector, but still relatively likely.

- Low - has too many or too unlikely assumptions or requires a significant stake by the attacker with little or no incentive.

## Action required for severity levels

- Critical - Must fix as soon as possible (if already deployed)

- High - Must fix (before deployment if not already deployed)

- Medium - Should fix

- Low - Could fix

# Findings

# [C-01] Unclaimed tokens locked in `stats_token` causing permanent fund loss

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** High

## Description

In the `claim_token` function, tokens are distributed to users based on the proportion of tokens they purchased relative to the total `claimed_supply`. If the `claimed_supply` is less than the `sale_supply`, users receive a proportional amount of `claimed_supply` rather than the full `sale_supply`.

This is reflected in the following code snippet:

```rust
let adjusted_tokens = ((user_stats.tokens_purchased as f64 / token_stats.claimed_supply as f64)
    * (token_stats.sale_supply.min(token_stats.claimed_supply) as f64))
    as u64;

transfer(
    CpiContext::new_with_signer(
        ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
        Transfer {
            from: ctx.accounts.stats_token.to_account_info(),
            to: ctx.accounts.user_token.to_account_info(),
            authority: ctx.accounts.stats.to_account_info(),
        },
        &[signer_seed],
    ),
    adjusted_tokens,
)?;
```

Since the amount distributed from `stats_token` is less than the `sale_supply` originally transferred to the `stats` account in `deposit_token`, as shown below:

```rust
pub fn deposit_token_handler(ctx: Context<DepositToken>) -> Result<()> {
    let token_stats = &mut ctx.accounts.token_stats;
    transfer(
        CpiContext::new(
            ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
            Transfer {
                from: ctx.accounts.authority_token.to_account_info(),
                to: ctx.accounts.stats_token.to_account_info(),
                authority: ctx.accounts.authority.to_account_info(),
            },
        ),
        token_stats.sale_supply,
    )?;
```

This results in the difference between `sale_supply` and `claimed_supply` being locked indefinitely in the `stats_token` account, causing a permanent loss of funds for the protocol.

## Recommendations

To mitigate this issue, consider implementing one of the following solutions:

1. Introduce a function to transfer the difference between `sale_supply` and `claimed_supply` back to the authority account if any surplus exists.
2. Modify the `claim_revenue` function to account for this difference and transfer the remaining tokens accordingly.

# [H-01] `withdraw_tokens` fails to adjust `claimed_supply` locking tokens permanently

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Medium

## Description

The `withdraw_tokens` function allows users to reclaim their payment tokens if the `min_threshold` is not met. However, the function does not update `claimed_supply` or transfer `tokens_purchased` back to the authority to reflect the refunded amounts.

Since the userâ€™s stats are marked as claimed, the corresponding `tokens_purchased` remain locked indefinitely.

For example, if a user has `tokens_purchased = 1000` and the `claimed_supply = 5000`, after withdrawal, and then he call the `withdraw_tokens` function and get his payment tokens back and only `4000` tokens can be claimed by others, while `1000` tokens remain permanently locked.

The relevant code snippet is shown below:

```rust
pub fn withdraw_token_handler(ctx: Context<WithdrawToken>) -> Result<()> {
    let token_stats = &mut ctx.accounts.token_stats;
    let user_stats: &mut Account<UserStats> = &mut ctx.accounts.user_stats;

    let curr_time = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    require!(
        token_stats.end_time < curr_time,
        RocketxLaunchpadError::InvalidWithdrawTime
    );
    require!(
        token_stats.is_launched,
        RocketxLaunchpadError::TokenNotLaunched
    );
    require!(
        !user_stats.is_claimed,
        RocketxLaunchpadError::TokenAlreadyClaimed
    );
    require!(
        token_stats.revenue < token_stats.min_threshold,
        RocketxLaunchpadError::InvalidThreshold
    );

    user_stats.is_claimed = true;

    let signer_seed = &[STATS_SEED, &[ctx.accounts.stats.bump]];

    let refund_amount = (((user_stats.tokens_purchased as f64)
        / (10u64.pow(token_stats.decimals as u32) as f64))
        * (token_stats.price_per_token as f64)) as u64;

    transfer(
        CpiContext::new_with_signer(
            ctx.accounts.token_program.to_account_info(),
            Transfer {
                from: ctx.accounts.stats_pay_token.to_account_info(),
                to: ctx.accounts.user_pay_token.to_account_info(),
                authority: ctx.accounts.stats.to_account_info(),
            },
            &[signer_seed],
        ),
        refund_amount,
    )?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Recommendations

To properly reflect the token refund and prevent permanent token locking, consider the following mitigations:

1. **Subtract `tokens_purchased` from `claimed_supply`** when a user withdraws their payment tokens.
2. **Transfer the corresponding `tokens_purchased` amount back to the authority** to ensure the tokens are not locked indefinitely.

# [H-02] `claim_revenue` lets admin block user withdrawals below min threshold

## Severity

**Impact:** High

**Likelihood:** Medium

## Description

The `claim_revenue` function should not be executable if the revenue falls below the `min_threshold`. In this case, users are allowed to reclaim their payment tokens after the sale duration ends. However, if the admin calls the `claim_revenue` function immediately after the sale ends, users will no longer be able to withdraw their payment tokens via `withdraw_token`.

The `withdraw_token` function requires the revenue to be less than `min_threshold` to enable withdrawals, as shown in the code snippet below:

```rust
pub fn withdraw_token_handler(ctx: Context<WithdrawToken>) -> Result<()> {
    require!(
        token_stats.is_launched,
        RocketxLaunchpadError::TokenNotLaunched
    );

    require!(
        !user_stats.is_claimed,
        RocketxLaunchpadError::TokenAlreadyClaimed
    );

    require!(
        token_stats.revenue < token_stats.min_threshold,
        RocketxLaunchpadError::InvalidThreshold
    );
```

If the admin withdraws the revenue, users will be unable to withdraw their payment tokens. Additionally, if a user withdraws some payment tokens, the admin will not be able to call `claim_revenue` because the balance of `stats_pay_token` will be lower than `token_stats.revenue`, causing the transfer to fail.

## Recommendations

Consider implementing one of the following fixes:

1. **Disable `claim_revenue` if the launchpad has not reached the minimum revenue threshold**, allowing only users to reclaim their payment tokens.
2. **Introduce a cooldown period for `claim_revenue`**, giving users time to withdraw their payment tokens before the admin can claim revenue. Modify `claim_revenue` to transfer only the remaining payment token balance in the `stats_pay_token` account.

# [M-01] Prevent token claims if the minimum threshold is not surpassed

## Severity

**Impact:** Medium

**Likelihood:** Medium

## Description

Allowing users to either **claim tokens** or **withdraw payment tokens** when the `min_threshold` is not met can result in locked funds. If some users claim their tokens while others withdraw, this creates a scenario where uncollected payments remain in the contract, leading to fund loss.

To prevent this, token claims should be restricted if the minimum revenue threshold has not been surpassed.

## Recommendations

Add the following check to the `claim_tokens` function to ensure tokens can only be claimed when the revenue meets or exceeds the minimum threshold:

```rust
require!(
    token_stats.revenue >= token_stats.min_threshold,
    RocketxLaunchpadError::InvalidThreshold
);
```

# [L-01] Incorrect check for > 0 buy amt

Describe the finding and your recommendation here

`buy_token` incorrectly checks that `token_amount` is greater than 0, rather than checking that `buy_amount` is > 0. As a result, 0 amount of tokens can be bought.

```rust
    require!(args.token_amount > 0, RocketxLaunchpadError::InvalidAmount);
```

Recommend refactoring the check to check for `buy_amount` instead. This also fixes the check below since `buy_amount` is first set to the min of `token_amount` and `limit_per_wallet - tokens_purchased`

```rust
    require!(
        user_stats.tokens_purchased <= token_stats.limit_per_wallet,
        RocketxLaunchpadError::ExceedsLimit
    );
```

# [L-02] Missing maximum cooldown duration validation

The `cooldown_duration` value provided in `args.cooldown_duration` is directly assigned to `token_stats.cooldown_duration` without any validation. This allows users to set an excessively long cooldown period, which could negatively impact the protocol's usability and fairness.

```rust
token_stats.cooldown_duration = args.cooldown_duration;
```

Introduce a **maximum cooldown period** by adding a check to ensure that `cooldown_duration` does not exceed a predefined upper limit.

Example fix:

```rust
require!(
    args.cooldown_duration <= MAX_COOLDOWN_DURATION,
    RocketxLaunchpadError::InvalidCooldownDuration
);

token_stats.cooldown_duration = args.cooldown_duration;
```

# [L-03] Unused `is_lp_created` flag

The `token_stats.is_lp_created` flag is updated in the `update_token_handler` function but is not used elsewhere in the contract. This could indicate unnecessary state storage, leading to redundant data or potential confusion in the contract logic.

```rust
pub fn update_token_handler(ctx: Context<UpdateToken>) -> Result<()> {
    let token_stats = &mut ctx.accounts.token_stats;

    token_stats.is_lp_created = true;

    Ok(())
}
```

Consider either utilizing the `is_lp_created` flag in relevant logic or removing it if it is not required.

# [L-04] Missing toolchain version in Anchor.toml

The `Anchor.toml` file does not specify the `anchor_version` or `solana_version` under the `[toolchain]` section. This can lead to compatibility issues when building or deploying the program, especially if different team members or CI/CD pipelines use different versions of Anchor or Solana.

```bash
[toolchain]

[features]
resolution = true
skip-lint = false

[programs.devnet]
desci_launchpad = "BtUNgrRufngrdEbXMnqUQjWP5LhKGGkz89U75k5tuaSj"

[registry]
url = "https://api.apr.dev"

[provider]
cluster = "Devnet"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"

[scripts]
deploy = "anchor build && solana program deploy ./target/deploy/desci_launchpad.so --skip-fee-check --max-sign-attempts 60 --use-rpc --with-compute-unit-price 50000"
test = "yarn run ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 1000000 tests/desci-launchpad.ts"

```

Recommendation:

Add the `anchor_version` and `solana_version` to the `[toolchain]` section to ensure consistent builds and deployments.

# [L-05] Use of `transfer` instead of `transfer_checked`

In the `buy_token_handler` function and other function, the `transfer` instruction is used to transfer tokens from the user's payment token account to the stats payment token account. However, `transfer` does not validate the mint account or the number of decimals, which can lead to potential issues:

1. **Mint Mismatch**: If the wrong mint account is passed, the transfer could succeed but involve the wrong token.
2. **Decimal Mismatch**: If the number of decimals is incorrect, the amount transferred could be different from what was intended (e.g., sending 1,000,000 tokens instead of 10 due to a decimal mismatch).

Replace the `transfer` instruction with `transfer_checked`, which requires the mint account and the number of decimals to be passed.

# [L-06] All administrative keys are identical

The constants `DEV_PUBKEY`, `ADMIN_PUBKEY`, and `MINT_AUTHORITY_PUBKEY` are all set to the same value:

```rust
pub const DEV_PUBKEY: Pubkey = pubkey!("BjjFpCbTrFVn3ZgcdCv4jTLAzbbDCMV1Vo115XJSJ7XG");
pub const ADMIN_PUBKEY: Pubkey = pubkey!("BjjFpCbTrFVn3ZgcdCv4jTLAzbbDCMV1Vo115XJSJ7XG");
pub const MINT_AUTHORITY_PUBKEY: Pubkey = pubkey!("BjjFpCbTrFVn3ZgcdCv4jTLAzbbDCMV1Vo115XJSJ7XG");
```

This design poses a risk because it centralizes all administrative privileges into a single key. If this key is compromised, an attacker could gain control over all administrative functions, including:

- Development operations (`DEV_PUBKEY`)
- Administrative actions (`ADMIN_PUBKEY`)
- Minting authority (`MINT_AUTHORITY_PUBKEY`)

If the shared key is compromised, the entire system is at risk. An attacker could perform unauthorized actions, such as minting tokens, modifying configurations, or accessing sensitive data.

Recommendation:

Assign unique public keys to `DEV_PUBKEY`, `ADMIN_PUBKEY`, and `MINT_AUTHORITY_PUBKEY` to ensure role separation.

# [L-07] State inconsistency due to solana rollback

One function in the protocol is vulnerable to state inconsistencies in the event of a Solana rollback:

1. **Setting Config Parameters**:
   - Global configuration parameters could become outdated during a Solana rollback
   - Protocol could operate with old, invalid settings
   - Potential for system malfunction or vulnerabilities

Recommendation:

1. **Detect Outdated Configurations**

   - Utilize the `LastRestartSlot` sysvar to check configuration validity
   - Automatically pause protocol if configuration is outdated
   - Require admin intervention before resuming operations

2. **Add last_updated_slot Field**

   - Include tracking field in bonding curve state
   - Monitor configuration update timestamps

3. **Implement Outdated Configuration Check**
   ```rust
   fn is_config_outdated(global: &Global) -> Result<bool> {
       let last_restart_slot = LastRestartSlot::get()?;
       Ok(global.last_updated_slot <= last_restart_slot.last_restart_slot)
   }
   ```

# [L-08] Missing validation for `start_time` and `end_time`

The `create_token_handler` function does not validate whether the `start_time` and `end_time` provided in the `CreateTokenArgs` are in the future relative to the current time.

This can lead to the following issue:

**Invalid Launchpad Timing**: If `start_time` or `end_time` is in the past, the token sale may start or end immediately.

**Code Location :** [create_token.rs](https://github.com/merklelabshq/desci-launchpad/blob/master/contract/programs/desci-launchpad/src/instructions/create_token.rs)

```rust
    token_stats.token_id = ctx.accounts.stats.tokens_created;
    token_stats.name = args.name.clone();
    token_stats.symbol = args.symbol.clone();
    token_stats.uri = args.uri.clone();
    token_stats.decimals = args.decimals;
    token_stats.payment_token = args.payment_token.key();
    token_stats.total_supply = args.total_supply;
    token_stats.sale_supply = args.sale_supply;
    token_stats.limit_per_wallet = args.limit_per_wallet;
    token_stats.price_per_token = args.price_per_token;
    token_stats.start_time = args.start_time;
    token_stats.end_time = args.end_time;
    token_stats.cooldown_duration = args.cooldown_duration;
    token_stats.min_threshold = args.min_threshold;
    token_stats.max_threshold = args.max_threshold;
    token_stats.bump = ctx.bumps.token_stats;
```

Add validation to ensure that both `start_time` and `end_time` are in the future relative to the current time. Use the `Clock::get()?` function to retrieve the current timestamp and compare it with `start_time` and `end_time`.
